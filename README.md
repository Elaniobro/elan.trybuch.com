## üîë API Key & Documentation:
_TBD_

### ‚úÖ Linting
This repo also has specific guidlines built into it, to help reduce the strain on code reviews. These rules are subject to change, but should ONLY be ammended through a pull request pending a code review. The files are also ran through a linter on `staged files` to verify that they adhere to the rules. You may run the command at anytime locally to check yourself.
```bash
yarn lint
```

## üß™ Testing
This repo will check that all tests pass on any and all `staged files` prior to pushing. If you wish to test locally you may run the following command:
```bash
yarn test
```

## ‚≠ê Best Practice
Please name all git branches with a task ticket number.
```bash
$ git branch
* master
$ git checkout -b GIT-0-update-readme
Switched to a new branch 'GIT-0-update-readme'
$ git branch
* GIT-0-update-readme
  master
```
Please use the branch ticket number as a prefix for your commit(s), use the imperative voice and try to keep the title commit under 50 characters. This can be done when saying to yourself,  "this commit will: `your commit message here`."
_replace the code block in the quote with the commit message_
```bash
git commit -m "Update README.md with more sections"
```
The commit message should be short and to the point. You _may_ be verbose and feel free to use any voice you wish, if you use a double commit message flag `-m` like so:
```bash
git commit -m "Update README.md with more sections" -m "I can now say whatever I want here, I can be as long as I like as well, since everything mentioned here, will fall under the ellipse when viewing this in git. and or fall under the long form log."
```
